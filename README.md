# VotingOS
Voting System is a system that has been created by J Dookarun, created to rebuild and design the current method of voting. This program has been built in a secondary school environment, with the program specificially tailored for the voting of Head Boy and Head Girl. During the course of this program, the user is able to customise details (admin sector) followed by the ability to vote. Do note that only students are given the ability to vote. With the new update, the system is now active with the login features and so if the user has previously voted, they will be restricted to carry on.
